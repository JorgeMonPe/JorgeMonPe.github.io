Insight into how environmental change determines the production and distribution of cyanobacterial toxins is necessary for risk assessment. Management guidelines currently focus on hepatotoxins (microcystins). Increasing attention is given to other classes, such as neurotoxins (e.g., anatoxin-a) and cytotoxins (e.g., cylindrospermopsin) due to their potency. Most studies examine the relationship between individual toxin variants and environmental factors, such as nutrients, temperature and light. In summer 2015, we collected samples across Europe to investigate the effect of nutrient and temperature gradients on the variability of toxin production at a continental scale. Direct and indirect effects of temperature were the main drivers of the spatial distribution in the toxins produced by the cyanobacterial community, the toxin concentrations and toxin quota. Generalized linear models showed that a Toxin Diversity Index (TDI) increased with latitude, while it decreased with water stability. Increases in TDI were explained through a significant increase in toxin variants such as MC-YR, anatoxin and cylindrospermopsin, accompanied by a decreasing presence of MC-LR. While global warming continues, the direct and indirect effects of increased lake temperatures will drive changes in the distribution of cyanobacterial toxins in Europe, potentially promoting selection of a few highly toxic species or strains.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018. Under ongoing climate change and increasing anthropogenic activity, which continuously challenge ecosystem resilience, an in-depth understanding of ecological processes is urgently needed. Lakes, as providers of numerous ecosystem services, face multiple stressors that threaten their functioning. Harmful cyanobacterial blooms are a persistent problem resulting from nutrient pollution and climate-change induced stressors, like poor transparency, increased water temperature and enhanced stratification. Consistency in data collection and analysis methods is necessary to achieve fully comparable datasets and for statistical validity, avoiding issues linked to disparate data sources. The European Multi Lake Survey (EMLS) in summer 2015 was an initiative among scientists from 27 countries to collect and analyse lake physical, chemical and biological variables in a fully standardized manner. This database includes in-situ lake variables along with nutrient, pigment and cyanotoxin data of 369 lakes in Europe, which were centrally analysed in dedicated laboratories. Publishing the EMLS methods and dataset might inspire similar initiatives to study across large geographic areas that will contribute to better understanding lake responses in a changing environment.},

abstract = {The size–abundance spectrum (SAS) of phytoplankton is controlled by the interplay of physical and biological factors whose particular relevance varies between ecosystems. Here we report the results of a study of phytoplankton SAS in a system of eight estuarine shallow, eutrophic lagoons (Guadalhorce river, South Spain). SAS were obtained through a combination of flow cytometry and image analysis microscopy techniques covering six orders of magnitude from picoplankton to microplankton. Cell numbers were classified into a log2 scale of cell volume to model the log–log relation between cell abundance (cells/mL) and cell volume ($\mu$m3). The resulting averaged phytoplankton SAS can be described by a log–log transformed, power model with a slope of – 0.62 (that is, there is an allometric relation between the size and abundance of cells). The distribution of biovolume ($\mu$m3/l) in broader size categories is characterized by the dominance of nanoplankton (67.4{\%}), followed by microplankton (30.1{\%}) and picoplankton (2.5{\%}). The minor relative contribution of picoplankton to total biovolume can be explained by a combination of high and variable rates of nutrient inputs, light stress and grazing. The biomass dominance of intermediate-size cells (nanoplankton) is coherent with experimental findings describing the unimodal size scaling of growth rate, with maximum values centered in this size category.},

abstract = {Monomictic reservoirs and lakes undergo to a thermally stratified period during the year. Summer-autumn stratification in monomictic reservoirs isolates bottom waters (hypolimnion) from upper layers (epilimnion) and surface. During this period, hypolimnion would become anoxic and restrict aerobic processes, therefore, changing ecosystem metabolic paths and rates and altering carbon fluxes. Hydrological and temperature changes associated to global warming are expected to alter the extent and volume of the anoxic hypolimnetic layer. To understand how aerobic or anaerobic metabolic processes change throughout the stratified period is needed to evaluate how future hydrological changes affect the carbon balance in these ecosystems. In this study, we measured aerobic primary production (GPP) and community respiration (ER) rates during the stratified period in the whole water column of a warm monomictic reservoir located in South Spain. High-frequency data recorded from a moored automatic monitoring station were used to estimate aerobic respiration and primary production through the ‘diel oxygen technique'. The monitoring platform was fitted with a meteorological station and a set of limnological probes performing vertical profiles (1 m depth resolution) of many physico-chemical variables (i.e. water temperature, PAR radiation, dissolved oxygen concentration, conductivity and chlorophyll a concentration) on a 4 hours frequency. Results demonstrated a net autotrophic epilimnion, with GPP and ER mean rates of 47.3 (±18.3) and 10.9 (±13.8) mmol O 2 m -3 day -1 , respectively. However, metalimnion depicted balanced ER and GPP rates, 15.4 (±20.6) and 16.9 (±19.2) mmol O 2 m -3 day -1 , respectively, with net ecosystem production (NEP=GPP-ER) close to 0. A negative relationship between epilimnetic ER and hypolimnetic ER suggests an increase of organic matter respiration in the reservoir upper layers throughout the stratification period.},
